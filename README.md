### CDM Slash Command

This fork is meant to amplify Luckyone's addon by adding the choice to set which slash command opens Blizzard's Cooldown Manager.

This small Addon leaves the register of the `/wa` chat command, should WeakAuras ever return to the game, as well as registering `/cdm` by default as a chat command to toggle Blizzard's own Cooldown Manager.
